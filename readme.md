# IR Sensor Config Files
Simple repo of person config files for remote commands and macros for using them in common use
scenarios. This is currently specific to lirc, rather than the newer gipo-ir (probably for the next overhaul)

- Install lirc
- Symlink the two .conf files into `/etc/lirc`
- The scripts just call commands in sequence to do common things!
